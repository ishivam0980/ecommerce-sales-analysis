## Executive Summary

This research employs quantitative methodologies to analyze customer purchasing patterns in e-commerce. Using a dataset of over 500,000 transactions from a UK-based online retailer, the study explores customer segmentation, seasonal trends, product performance, and geographic distribution of sales. 

Key findings confirm the Pareto principle in both customer value and product performance, with approximately 20% of customers generating nearly 80% of revenue. The analysis also reveals significant seasonal patterns, with peak sales occurring during the October-December period, and identifies distinct customer segments based on recency, frequency, and monetary value of purchases.

The insights derived from this research provide evidence-based recommendations for strategic decision-making in e-commerce operations, particularly in inventory management, marketing resource allocation, and customer retention strategies.
